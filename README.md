# Kraan
Twitter like web application developed with @mcanal8 & Lucía Gasión in our third year of Computer Science Degree at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.  
Course name: Web Applications Engineering.  
Language: Java.  
IDE: Eclipse.  
Objective: Learn to apply Web Applications Engineering techniques to a real project. To do so, we developed what could be a real project, a Twitter like Social Network.

## Description
Social Network application very similar to Twitter. In Kraan people can register, log in, make, edit and delete tweets, view tweets by topics, view user profiles, follow, and unfollow people and access it anonymously.
